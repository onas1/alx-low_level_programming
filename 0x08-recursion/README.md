## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General


    What is recursion
    How to implement recursion
    In what situations you should implement recursion
    In what situations you shouldnt implement recursion


## Requirements

### General


    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc is forbidden
    You are allowed to use _putchar
    You dont have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it wont be taken into account
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
    Dont forget to push your header file
    You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
